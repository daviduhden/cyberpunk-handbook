      <h1>1. Physical Security</h1>

      <section>
        <h2>1.1 Verified Boot</h2>

        <p>Verified Boot is a security mechanism that ensures only trusted, cryptographically signed binaries—such as the firmware, operating system, and bootloader—are loaded during the boot process. At startup, the firmware verifies these components, and if any fail authentication due to unauthorized modifications, the boot process is halted and a warning screen is displayed. In systems that support recovery measures, a clean backup image may be restored automatically.</p>

        <p>This mechanism is essential for preventing firmware-level malware, rootkits, and other preboot threats. Preboot rootkits, for example, can provide attackers with deep control over the system before the operating system fully loads, making detection and removal extremely challenging. Verified Boot blocks these types of low-level malware from executing, thereby reinforcing the integrity of the system from the very start.</p>

        <h4>Types of Attacks Prevented by Verified Boot</h4>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Firmware Malware:</strong> An attacker who compromises the firmware can modify it to load malicious code at every boot. Verified Boot mitigates this risk by ensuring that only authenticated firmware is executed.</li>

          <li><strong>Preboot Rootkits:</strong> These malicious programs load before the operating system and can evade conventional detection tools. Verified Boot prevents their execution by verifying the authenticity of every critical binary.</li>

          <li><strong>Boot-Level Persistence Attacks:</strong> If an attacker gains access to the system and modifies the bootloader to execute malicious code at every restart, malware can reappear even after being seemingly removed. Verified Boot detects unauthorized changes and blocks the boot process in such cases.</li>

          <li><strong>Kernel Tampering Attacks:</strong> Some attackers attempt to modify the operating system kernel to run malicious code with elevated privileges. Verified Boot ensures the kernel’s integrity before it is loaded, preventing any unauthorized alterations.</li>

          <li><strong>Malicious Binary Injection:</strong> Should an attacker replace critical binaries with modified versions that include backdoors, Verified Boot will detect the changes and stop the system from booting with the unauthorized binaries.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Linux and UEFI Secure Boot</h3>

        <p>Several Linux distributions support UEFI Secure Boot, including:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Fedora:</strong> Supported since Fedora 18 (2013). <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/18/FeatureList" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fedora 18 Feature List</a>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Ubuntu:</strong> <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UEFI/SecureBoot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubuntu UEFI Secure Boot Wiki</a> <a href="https://broken-by-design.fr/posts/secure-boot-not/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Secure Boot Not?</a>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Debian:</strong> Supported since Debian Buster (2019). <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/buster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Debian Buster Release</a> <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/SecureBoot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Debian Secure Boot Wiki</a>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>openSUSE:</strong> Supported since openSUSE 12.3 (2013). <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:UEFI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">openSUSE UEFI</a>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Oracle Linux:</strong> Supported since version 7.3 (2016). <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Linux on Wikipedia</a> <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/oracle-linux/notice-sboot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle Linux Secure Boot Documentation</a>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>To achieve secure boot support, a prebootloader binary called <em>shim</em> is used to verify both the bootloader and the Linux kernel. These distributions typically pay Microsoft to have the <em>shim</em> binary signed, as most consumer laptops recognize only Microsoft’s Secure Boot keys (along with OEM keys). Currently, Verified Boot/Secure Boot support on hardware platforms managed by Apple or Google is not available.</p>

        <h3>Flaws in Current Linux Implementations</h3>

        <p>Despite these measures, many Linux distributions have compromised UEFI Secure Boot to the extent that it is largely ineffective against remote attackers or local attackers (when disk encryption is not used). The <em>shim</em> binary only verifies the bootloader and kernel, leaving the base operating system unverified—a significant vulnerability. This issue affects even security-focused Linux distributions:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"A remote attacker (or a physical attacker when not using encryption) can simply modify any other privileged part of the operating system. For example, if they have the privileges to modify the kernel, then they'd also be able to modify /sbin/init to achieve effectively the same result. Thus, only verifying the kernel and bootloader will not do anything against a remote attacker. To mitigate this, you must verify the base operating system with dm-verity, although this is very difficult and cumbersome due to the layout of traditional Linux distributions."</p>

          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <h4>A Brief Overview of dm-verity Implementation</h4>

        <p>To achieve full Verified Boot, the following steps are generally recommended:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Use a read-only filesystem for partitions containing executable code, enforced by dm-verity (or alternatives such as fs-verity with file signatures or Linux IMA).</li>

          <li>Employ the noexec mount option on data partitions.</li>

          <li>Modify command interpreters to avoid executing scripts from mount points with the noexec option or from STDIN.</li>

          <li>Patch the kernel to prevent execution of writable memory.</li>

          <li>Ensure that no executable configuration file remains writable.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For further insights, see: <a href="https://broken-by-design.fr/posts/secure-boot-not/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Secure Boot Not?</a></p>

        <p>Another approach is to replace Microsoft's Secure Boot keys with your own. This requires signing a unified kernel image (combining the Linux kernel and bootloader into a single binary). However, replacing the platform keys can be risky and may brick your computer, especially since many devices rely on Microsoft's or the vendor's certificate for signing device firmware (e.g., GPU firmware). See section 3.1 of the Arch Wiki article on UEFI Secure Boot: <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface/Secure_Boot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arch Wiki: Unified Extensible Firmware Interface/Secure Boot</a></p>

        <p>Even if you manage to roll out your own keys without bricking your device, full Verified Boot is not achieved unless the base operating system is also signed. As one author explains:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"Since replacing the Microsoft keys and signing only authorized binaries (i.e. our own Unified Kernel Image and specifically not shim) is an option, why not do that? ... However, the kernel must then verify the operating system to ensure that only verified software is run, which requires cryptographic verification of every single executable in the system."</p>

          <p><a href="https://broken-by-design.fr/posts/secure-boot-not/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Secure Boot Not?</a>
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Furthermore, a key challenge is that there is no clear definition of which files are critical to system functionality. Unlike major operating systems—where system-critical files are placed on a separate, immutable system partition—Linux distributions typically store all binaries (whether critical or not) in the same directories (such as <code>/usr/bin</code> and <code>/usr/local/bin</code>). This lack of segregation makes it extremely difficult to establish an effective verification mechanism.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"Android, macOS, and ChromeOS have a clear distinction between system and user-installed applications. The system volume is signed by the OS vendor and remains immutable, ensuring that only authorized code runs. In contrast, Linux distributions mix system-critical files with other applications, making it nearly impossible to verify the integrity of 'the system'."</p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>

        <p>In practice, enabling or disabling Secure Boot on a Linux distribution often makes little difference because attackers can exploit unsigned system files to bypass the protection. Achieving full Verified Boot—whether using Microsoft's keys or custom keys—is extremely challenging because system-critical files and user-installed application binaries are stored together. For a truly secure implementation, Linux distributions must segregate critical system files onto a separate, immutable partition and sign them accordingly.</p>

        <p>Until this change is adopted by Linux distro developers, users seeking a robust full Verified Boot implementation may be better off using systems such as ChromeOS or Android.</p>
